Project: 03 Text Adventure
Peer's repository: https://github.com/SilverSock69/03-Text-Adventures


What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned a little about json files, the game was having trouble finding
some rooms but it turned out there was one "}" too early, closing the rooms
section of the file.

 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I enjoyed the randomness of the rooms, some being cheery and some pretty brutal. It made for kind of a 
unique surreal tone that was intriguing.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
It would have been convenient if the locations you could go to were listed
since you can't always go all 4 directions, but it seems like that was also
an issue with the classic text adventure games so no big deal. I did a rough
implementation of that before I played it.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
The main is mostly the stuff from class I think, so I didn't feel like it
needed more comments.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
No it was explained in class so it was fine.


Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yeah it has a name and year.


What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
I think the readme is fine, most people would probably know to run main
and it says what the project is.


Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
I liked the game, it was fun wondering if the next room would kill me or
give me some cake.
